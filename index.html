        <h1>History</h1>
        
        <p> 
            The USS Texas (BB-35) is a New York-class battleship, launched in 1912 and commissioned in 1914. It has a rich and varied history, 
            having served in both World Wars. During World War I, it escorted convoys and participated in patrol missions in the Atlantic. <br> 
        </p>

        <h1>Life</h1>

        <p> 
            During World War II, the USS Texas played a crucial role in several major operations. It participated in the invasion of North Africa in 1942, providing naval 
            gunfire support for Allied troops. In 1944, it was involved in the Normandy landings,
            bombarding German positions on Omaha Beach to support the invading forces. Later that same year, it also took part in the invasion of southern France. <br> 
        </p>

        <h1>Now</h1>
           
        <p>
            After the war, the USS Texas was decommissioned and transformed into a museum ship. 
            Since 1948, it has been moored in La Porte, Texas, where it is open to the public. The ship is a living testament to 
            American naval history and continues to attract visitors from around the world.
